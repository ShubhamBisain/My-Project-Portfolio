      Hi, I’m Shubham Bisain, a passionate student of Electrical and Electronics Engineering BSc. at Hochschule Rhein-Waal University of Applied Sciences in Kleve, Germany. I’m deeply enthusiastic about combining theoretical knowledge with practical applications to innovate and create projects that inspire curiosity and growth.

      With a good foundation in embedded systems and digital electronics, I enjoy exploring the intersection of hardware and software. My journey so far has been fueled by my fascination with automation, creativity, and technology—all of which motivate me to turn concepts into tangible, real-world solutions.

      What Drives Me
    </p>

    <p>
      For me, every project is an opportunity to bridge theory with practice. I love taking an idea, diving deep into the development process, and seeing it evolve into a functional and innovative solution. It’s not just about the end result—it’s about the learning, creativity, and collaboration involved along the way.
