      Project Overview:
    </p>

    <p>
      This project is a personal website created using HTML and CSS and hosted on GitHub Pages. It serves as a showcase for all the self-made projects Iâ€™ve worked on so far. The website is still under development, and it currently only includes self-initiated projects. University-mandated or voluntary projects are not yet included.
    </p>
    <p>
      The website aims to act as an online portfolio, representing my work and skills in an organized and visually appealing way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Future initiative is to add more projects, including current running self made projects, university mandatory and voluntary projects.
